<h1>Contract - WEB 115 Web Markup and Scripting </h1>

I, Sabrina Nur, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2018 WEB115_85 Web markup and Scripting tools with my instructor,  D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

<p>Signed: Sabrina Nur, January 11, 2018
